# highlander-havoc-7
Highlander Havoc 7 is a 2D game built on the lwjgl library.

## install

in the `install` folder, there are two folders, `natives` and `jars`. In eclipse you need to add all three jars in the jars folder as external jars to the project. Once these are added, you need to set the `native library location` of `lwjgl.jar` to `natives/[your operating system]`.

You're all set.
